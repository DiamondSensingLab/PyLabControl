Hardware:
GPIB
SRS signal generator (microwaves)
    set freq, phase, amp
    iq modulation on/off
    frequency sweep (start, end, sweep as function of external voltage)
    starting conditions
Pulseblaster
Montana cryostat (wait for email)
USB devices (rotation stage, linear driver)
Zicontrol


Attocube
picoharp




Software:
pandas
saving data
gui



python logging
exception control





Next things to do:
focusing routine
ESR
clean up pass on graphics code

ESR:
frequency range
amplitude
time per point
try to fit lorentzian to esr to find peak-lower priority
want to turn down laser power (switch to 5)


focusing routine:
voltage range 1-99
fit results to gaussian
take image 1/5-1/10 smaller than standard
have input be voltage, range, #pts
use current galvo voltage as center, make sure window around this point doesn't exceed max voltage (.5) on galvo


add green dot on top of current voltage
